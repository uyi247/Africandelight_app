# africandelight_app

Africandelight_app is an app dedicated to side dishes from West Africa, most especially Nigeria. As a country with a wide variety of ethnic communities, Nigeria has a varied and rich culinary tradition.
They have a myriad delicacies depending on what part of the country you are located and numerous ingredients and staples cut across state borders as well. This site is dedicated to some of my personal favorites and also gives users the ability to add their favorite side recipes from the great continent of mother Africa.
